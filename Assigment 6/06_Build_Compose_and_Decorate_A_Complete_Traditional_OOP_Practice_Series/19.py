# 19. callable() and __call__()
# Assignment:
# Create a class Multiplier with an __init__() to set a factor. Define a __call__() method that multiplies an input by the factor. Test it with callable() and by calling the object like a function.


class Multiplier:
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, value):
        return value * self.factor

triple = Multiplier(3)

print(callable(triple))  


print(triple(10))
